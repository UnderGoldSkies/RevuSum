'Negative_Review': "Stayed for 7 days so a bit more variety in breakfast food especially the fruit would be nice but again for the price it was fine. it took some time to get hot water when taking shower. restaurant closed quite early and no option to get food late at night within hotel. wifi in room was poor but hotel did provide a spare wifi gadget so it worked out okay. almost good but an aircontrol at my room didn't work a little bit so i feeled a little hot."
