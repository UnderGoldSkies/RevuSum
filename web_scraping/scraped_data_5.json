The toilet was also tiny and upon showering, the water doesn't drain properly so the floor stays wet. In the toilet, there is also only a grill on the ceiling right above the shower and so you can see all the pipes etc- kind of creepy in my opinion.

The window was directly overlooked by the flats behind.\nOverall I think there was more space at the Ibis Bencoolen which might be better value.\nThe only reason we booked was for the swimming pool but did not use as it was raining for most of the day and was overlooked by a new hotel under construction opposite."

When I checked in I stood for 5 minutes in front the front desk as they were too busy doing their own business before paying attention to me. Furthermore the lack of eye contact is really disappointing. It makes one feel insignificant and not valued. I was messed around when went for dinner after being told by reception that I can charge the dinner to my room. After agreeing with the front desk and the management of the restaurant to pay the bill when I check out I was woken up from my room to go to the restaurant and pay the bill. I asked before I checked in about a late checkout and was told flat out that the policy was 12:00pm and that if I wanted to check out later I would be charged per hour and yet when I checked out and was waiting in reception the Sunday, I witnessed a European man asking for late checkout and he was granted that with no issues and no charges. what made me even more disappointed was the way in which his request was handled and responded to versus the way my request was responded to. Clear prejudice. I am really disappointed with the hotel as I was made to believe by the reviews that this hotel was professional and welcoming. I really did not see nor feel that."

If you are sensitive to noise, make sure to avoid getting a room facing the major road.  There is  constant heavy traffic on the major road (trucks, loud motorbikes, etc.), and I could hear the sounds/feel the vibrations."

When I called at 10pm to replace my room\u2019s 6 feather pillows with 6 non-feather pillows, a housekeeper showed up with one pillow. A feather pillow. \nSo I made my another call to the front desk (with 2 tired and cranky toddlers) at 10:30pm, once again (this is the 4th time) for non-feather pillows I was told that the hotel only has feather pillows. I wish they had told me 2 months prior when I made the request. \nTo make matters worse the bathtub was grimy and in disrepair, and couldn\u2019t be filled (the drain was broken). I specifically chose this hotel because it has a bathtub, as I have 2 toddlers who like to bathe. \nWhen showering (our only option), the water pressure was very low. \nThe wifi is objectively terrible. If and when it connects, it is extremely slow. I could barely load email!\nThere is no complementary water (unusual for a 4-star hotel, especially at this price point) and the tap water has a bad smell. \nThe sound carries very easily and we could hear a crying child down the hall who sounded like he was in the room with us."

Floor didn't seem like it was cleaned (hoovered and mopped) as walking around bare feet felt uncomfortable.  Dusty sides and cupboards throughout the room.  Small amount of mould on one of the walls by the AC unit which looked like it had been cleaned in the past but was reoccurring.  Likely due to the climate making this an impossible task to completely remove.  Myself and partner did give it a wet wipe clean before feeling absolutely comfortable.  After our improvised clean we did give it a 4 in a bed style check over but didn't find any horrors and the bed was lovely and clean and it really wouldn't have took much to bring it to the top standard the rest of the hotel had.  They did allow us to check in early so we do think this may have been an isolated incident to get us in as quickly as possible which we were really greatful of as we just had a 20 hour commute to get there.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to other people so I hope my honest reviews don't put anyone off as we feel that this hotel really does a good job at catering for it's guest and the demographic of travellers it appeals to."

The indoor common area at the lobby is huge and facilitated with cafe and vending machines. The property even provide 24 hour gym for indoor and outdoor. \rStaff: Staff is very polite, helpful, friendly and thoughtful. They pay attention to special requests. They even gave an early birthday gift such as greeting card and cookies for my friend, even though he\u2019s not the one who made the booking to this property. In my previous experience, hotels only pay attention to guest who made the reservation. \rNeighbourhood: The neighborhood is very safe and quiet at night and day.

My room was also \nnice and the pillows and towels were clean and fluffy. \nI love the room design too and the view from the room. \nThe lounge at the lobby and the garden at level 4 were also cozy and\nnice. Make sure you don\u2019t miss to spend some times\nin the garden. I also love the water refill so we can reduce \nthe use of the plastic bottle. The guard when I checked out , \nAsraf, was also nice and helpful.\nOverall, I had a good experience at Lyf Farrer Park.\nOh the location was nice too, near to Little India and a\nlot of nice Indian Restos, and it was pretty quiet and peaceful at night.",

We made use of the laundry room (quite expensive), the gym, kitchen.\rWe thought not having housekeeping for a week was going to make our room messy and smelly, but it was fine. AC temperature was so perfect \rSuper loved that yeast side cafe was right in the lobby, amazing pastries.\rFor those planning to stay, you can request slippers and cotton buds at the counter upon check in!\rMrt and bus station is just a few steps away and I think that's one of the major upsides of this place.

Shower and toilet were in separate rooms which was great and both super clean. The shower (and esp rainfall attachment) was superb - the water pressure was better than the showers at Changi Lounge.  Quality shampoo, conditioner and body wash are included though l did end up preferring my own.  You can't really hear the traffic below except for some hornw and barely the water running in other rooms - if you need complete silence this may bother you but as a super light sleeper l had amazing sleep in my room. The free toiletries and other gifts were really welcome - l got two sets since the room was for two which l thought was really thoughtful. Big room with a large window which gave great light during the day, and three sets of lights which were great during the night. Each room can control its own aircon temperature which was great as the room was so refreshing after being out all day. Each floor has a water station, sink and mini fridge and a kettle + cups is included in the room. There isn't really anywhere to get ice or cold water though but it shouldn't be a great bother.\rCity Park Mall is just across the road, barely 2 minutes away which includes lots of food, Don Don Denki (a massive Japanese grocery store), Watsons (beauty/cosmetics), shopping and more.  The staff were really courteous and the lobby was a great place to hang out or relax before venturing out for the day. Wi-Fi was strong, didn't have any issues with it the entire stay. Outside area on level 4 was nice although too hot to stay around. Kitchen was nice although a strong grease smell.",
                "review_disliked": "I would recommend a place more central if you are going for the F1 weekend like l was. Several entrances for Farrer Park MRT are very close but to get to the platform it's still a walk and day after day it can be a bit much. Especially since you have to transfer at Dhoby Ghaut and possibly once more to get to the closest entrance to your gate. (Mine was Gate 1B). The nearest bus stop for me to get to the track was also almost two blocks away but keep in mind due to road closures during F1 there's more walking to be done. If you are planning on solely using public transport l would recommend somewhere closer in the city. As for Grab which l did use towards the end of my stay it was less than 10-15 minutes to just about anywhere which is fantastic if you are going to depend on driving instead. One of my Grab drivers did caution me about walking around in the neighbourhood at night but after several nights of returning around 11pm l didn't find it overly unnerving.   \rMy room was not ready for me upon check-in which wasn't great considering the flight/missing out on F1 events but l understand it was a busy time (waited around half an hour). The room made up for it in spades. Water does leak out under the shower door but that's easily remedied by placing one of your many towels underneath the door to absorb it - l didn't find it a major nuisance. Washing and drying on the first floor was great however you have to pay for them each separately which can add up especially given Singapore's weather you do end up washing clothes after every wear. The key card especially for the elevator could also be a bit glitchy at times. If your trip does bring you around the area then l wouldn't discourage you from staying. If the rooms and service is the same across its other locations then l would definitely stay with this chain again."

Additionally, our room was literally infested with little flies that kept coming up from the drains and were buzzing all over the room. We killed at least one hundred and still every time we came back we found many flying across the room. It made us vomit, utterly disgusting! I suggest the management to do something about the flies as it is unacceptable to sleep in a room full of flies. I am attaching pictures of a small number of the flies we had to kill to sleep in a quiet room without disturbance. Our stay was, in one word, UNPLEASANT! Avoid at all costs!"

Es gab eine Gemeinschaftsk\u00fcche und mehrere sch\u00f6ne R\u00e4ume in denen man sich aufhalten konnte, auch einen sch\u00f6nen Au\u00dfenbereich im 4. Stock. Waschmaschine und Trockner gab es auch. Zudem fanden viele Events statt. \nIn der N\u00e4he der Unterkunft gab es gute Einkaufsm\u00f6glichkeiten, direkte U-Bahn Anbindung und ein Caf\u00e9 sowie Pizzeria im Hotel. \nAuf email Anfragen im Vorfeld des Aufenthalts bekam ich sehr schnell (unter 12 Std.) eine Antwort.",
